Question 1 Achieving 1NF (First Normal Form) üõ†Ô∏è

Task:

    You are given the following table ProductDetail:

OrderID 	CustomerName 	Products
101 	John Doe 	Laptop, Mouse
102 	Jane Smith 	Tablet, Keyboard, Mouse
103 	Emily Clark 	Phone

    In the table above, the Products column contains multiple values, which violates 1NF.
    Write an SQL query to transform this table into 1NF, ensuring that each row represents a single product for an order
*/
    SELECT OrderID, CustomerName, Product
    FROM ProductDetail
    CROSS JOIN UNNEST(string_to_array(Products, ', ')) AS Product;



/*
Question 2 Achieving 2NF (Second Normal Form) üß©

    You are given the following table OrderDetails, which is already in 1NF but still contains partial dependencies:

OrderID 	CustomerName 	Product 	Quantity
101 	John Doe 	Laptop 	2
101 	John Doe 	Mouse 	1
102 	Jane Smith 	Tablet 	3
102 	Jane Smith 	Keyboard 	1
102 	Jane Smith 	Mouse 	2
103 	Emily Clark 	Phone 	1

    In the table above, the CustomerName column depends on OrderID (a partial dependency), which violates 2NF.

    Write an SQL query to transform this table into 2NF by removing partial dependencies. Ensure that each non-key column fully depends on the entire primary key.
